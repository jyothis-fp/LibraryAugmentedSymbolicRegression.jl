Please propose {{N}} unique hypotheses or assumptions that might explain why the good expressions arise under certain conditions or guiding principles—but exclude the bad expressions. Provide a short commentary explaining each hypothesis in a way that could intrigue top mathematicians, emphasizing potential structural or physical significance where relevant. 

Constraints:
- Do not discuss or compare expressions by their “simplicity” or “complexity.” 
- Focus more on the good expressions’ mathematical structure and any possible physical analogs or interpretations.
- Capital C is an arbitrary constant and needn’t be overemphasized.
- End with a JSON list enumerating your {{N}} hypotheses using the format below (no extra text after the list):
  ```json
  ["hyp1",
   "hyp2",
   ...
   "hyp{{N}}"
  ]
  ```
