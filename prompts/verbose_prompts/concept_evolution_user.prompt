You are given the following ideas about certain hidden phenomena:

Idea 1: {{idea1}}
Idea 2: {{idea2}}
Idea 3: {{idea3}}
Idea 4: {{idea4}}
Idea 5: {{idea5}}

I want you to:
1. Provide a short summary (1–2 sentences) of how these ideas might intersect or relate.
2. Propose {{N}} hypotheses that could lead to new or deeper insights into these hidden phenomena. 
   - Avoid referencing their simplicity or complexity.
   - Focus on unique, novel angles that might intrigue experts in any relevant field.
3. For each hypothesis, add **one or two sentences** of commentary explaining why it could be valid or insightful (but do not mention simplicity/complexity).
4. Finally, output a JSON array containing your {{N}} hypotheses, with no extra commentary or text after the JSON.

Your final output format should look like this (example):

-----
Short summary tying the ideas together.

Hypothesis 1
Short commentary

Hypothesis 2
Short commentary

...
(Hypothesis N + commentary)

```json
["hyp1",
 "hyp2",
 ...
 "hypN"]
```
-----

Remember:
- Do **not** talk about the “simplicity” or “complexity” of the phenomena.
- Keep your hypotheses focused on interesting, domain-agnostic insights unless the ideas strongly suggest a specific field.
- End with the JSON list and nothing else.
